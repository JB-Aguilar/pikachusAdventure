Pikachu's Adventure is a game inspired by The Legend of Zelda (NES) and set in a Pokemon environment. The objective of the game is to find a badge hidden in one of three Pokeball chests on the map and then make it to the Pokemon Center within one minute to win.

## Gameplay

The game is played from a top-down perspective, similar to The Legend of Zelda. You control Pikachu using either the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move around the map. The objective is to search for the badge hidden in one of three Pokeball chests scattered throughout the map. Once you have found the badge, a Pokemon Center will appear on the map.

You must make it to the Pokemon Center within one minute to win the game. If you fail to find the badge within one minute or fail to make it to the Pokemon Center in time, you will lose the game.
